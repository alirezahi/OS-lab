For command we have to enclose it with [] but if we are using && or || we have to enclose it with [[]]

## touch
If we use touch command if there will be no file with this name it will be created.

If there is a file with this name the modify date will be changed to current but the file will not change anyway.

## Switch Case
~~~
case $reply in
    Y|YES) echo "Displaying all (reallyâ€¦) files"
            ls -a ;;
    N|NO)  echo "Display all non-hidden files..."
            ls ;;
    Q)     exit 0 ;;
    *)     echo "Invalid choice!"; exit 1 ;;
esac
~~~
```;;``` means 'break' in thif syntax of switch case

```*``` means other choices of variable that was not present in previous case choices

## Regex
We can filter command with grep using regex. For example:
~~~
seq 1000 9999 | grep .2.2
~~~

To see if first letter and last letter are equal we can use this command
~~~
seq 10000 99999 | grep -E "([1-9])...\1" | more
~~~
